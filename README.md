# Guided Dialogue Policy Learning without Adversarial Learning in the Loop
This is the codebase for paper: "[Guided dialogue policy learning without adversarial learning in the loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03267v2)".

There are two different parts in this work: (1)training a reward model with GAN-VAE, and (2)using the trained reward function to guide dialogue policy learing in ConvLab.

For the training of each part, please go to the corresponding folder.
